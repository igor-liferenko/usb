sudo modprobe usbmon
sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:r /dev/usbmon*
plug device into bus which has no other devices and find bus number via lsusb
run wireshark
if "lsusb|grep 'Bus 00N'" shows 'root hub'
whose device number is 001, use this filter in wireshark '!(usb.device_address == 1)'
Note, that in wireshark start sniffing before device is connected, otherwise wireshark
will not recognize set control line state and set line coding requests.
