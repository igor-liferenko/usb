After the device is attached, the host will request the USB device descriptor using the default device address zero. On
successful transmission, it will send a USB reset. After that, it sends an address to be configured for the device. All
further transactions will be directed to this device address. This address should be configured in the Device Address field
in the Device Address register (DADD.DADD) and the Address Enable bit in DADD (DADD.ADDEN) should be written to
one to accept the communications directed to this address. DADD.ADDEN is automatically cleared on receiving a USB
reset.
