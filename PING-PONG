When an endpoint is configured for ping-pong operation, it uses both the input and output data buffers (banks) for a given
endpoint in a single direction. The direction is selected by enabling one of the IN or OUT direction in EPCFG.EPTYPE0/1
and configuring the opposite direction in EPCFG.EPTYPE1/0 as Dual Bank.
When ping-pong operation is enabled for an endpoint, the endpoint in the opposite direction must be configured as dual
bank. The data buffer, data address pointer and byte counter from the enabled endpoint are used as Bank 0, while the
matching registers from the disabled endpoint are used as Bank 1.
