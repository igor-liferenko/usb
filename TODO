TODO: find out how to use hidraw and use it to pass data to AVR from network
 which AVR will then pass to tel.w (create composite device like in arduino-combined.pcapng,
 but use OUT endpoint in HID instead of IN (see asm.S for an example))
see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hid/hidraw.txt
NOTE: CDC-ACM requires two Interface descriptors,
which will upset most hosts when part of a multi-function "Composite" USB
device. This is because each interface will be loaded into a separate driver
instance, causing the two interfaces be become unlinked. To prevent this, you
should use the "Interface Association Descriptor" addendum to the USB 2.0 standard
which is available on most OSes when creating Composite devices.
Check if this is the case on Linux and don't do "Interface Association Descriptor" if
each interface will not be loaded into a separate driver instance.
---------------------------
Also, do combined device and pass data to AVR via CDC, and from AVR via HID (like in kbd.w).
This is to login automatically. In rc.local put "echo >/dev/login"

do only keyboard and compare wireshark with arduino-combined.pcapng and what differs change in cdc.w to make cdc-kbd.w out of it

use this sketch:
int buttonPin = PORTD4;

void setup()
{
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);  // Set the button as an input
  digitalWrite(buttonPin, HIGH);  // Pull the button high
  TXLED0;
}

void loop()
{
  if (digitalRead(buttonPin) == 0)  // if the button goes low
  {
    Keyboard.press(KEY_ESC);
    Keyboard.release(KEY_ESC);
    delay(1000);  // delay so there aren't a kajillion z's
  }
}
