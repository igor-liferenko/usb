Proper steps to convert original Atmel's code to CWEB (in this repo it was done not properly):
1. github init avr-usb
2. md5sum of the usb-cdc archive (from ub0ali in 2 emails and from ub0ali in dropbox) - ensure that it is the same
3. unpack
4. git add
5. delete unused files (see git lg here - except flash_drv.s)
6. git st + check + git add
7. remove trailing \r from all files
8. git st + check + git add
9. git ci "initial import"
10. make it compile (fix usb_specific_request.c like this:
-extern U8   code *pbuffer;
+#ifdef __GNUC__
+  extern PGM_VOID_P pbuffer;
+#else
+  extern U8   code *pbuffer;
+#endif
)
11. configure (change "#define FOSC" to 16000 and "#define PLL_OUT_FRQ" to PLL_OUT_48MHZ and
"#define BAUDRATE" to 57600) + flash and check that it actually works (if it will not work - see
what else must be configured in commits up to commit "it is working now" here)
12. remove copyright
13. remove "#ifdef _GNUC_" to use avr-gcc
14. do maximum purging to preserve md5 of resulting .hex file (use "alias chk='md5sum -c /tex_tmp/md5'")
15. expand all "#define xxxxxx()" (also check that md5 is preserved)
16. convert to CWEB (rename .c to .w and add @ @c at the beginning of each .w file)
